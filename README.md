<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



Here are the rules of the game:

The player should roll two dice. If the sum of both of them is 7 or 11 the player wins. If the sum is 2, 3 or 12 (craps) the casino wins. If during the first roll the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10, that number becomes the “goal” number. To win, the player should roll the dice till they roll the goal number again. If the player rolls a 7 before rolling the goal number, they lose.



Your task is to recreate this game using Python. Your program should roll two dice and output the sum of two random numbers. By following the rules of the game, your program should decide whether the player wins or loses.




Write a program on Python that does the following:


* Allows the user to pick one of the templates
* Asks the user to input words. “Type number”, for example
* Generate a story afterwards and shows it to the user

Don't bother with any additional functions for now, but make sure your program follows these 3 conditions. You will have to use the “random” library, and the only functions you’ll be able to use will be print() and input() or make your own ones. We recommend using one of the three templates provided, which will make the evaluation process easier for your peers.
